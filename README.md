# 2D systolic array
Created a 2D systolic array for accelerating GEMM followed by ReLU. 
Part5mod contains all the files that implement the expansion of input channels.
Part6 contains all the files that implement the memory double buffering and on-the-fly accumulation feature.
The "Project_VGG16_Quantization_aware_train-Copy1 (1).ipynb" script trains the model and grabs the activation and weights.
